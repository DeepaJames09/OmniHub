Inefficient physician allocaHon poses significant challenges to the Canadian healthcare 
system, resulHng in prolonged waiHng Hmes for paHents and unequal access to care, parHcularly 
among marginalized populaHons. The OmniHub Capstone Project seeks to tackle these issues by 
applying analyHcs to provide acHonable insights for resource allocaHon and decision-making.
Beginning with a detailed analysis of the business problem, the project emphasizes the 
crucial impact of physician distribuHon on paHent care and the necessity of data-driven 
approaches to address inefficiencies. Through structured sprint planning, key analyHcs quesHons 
and objecHves were idenHfied, guiding subsequent phases of data preparaHon, soluHon design, 
and development.
Detailed processes for data manipulaHon, including cleaning, transformaHon, and storage, 
were outlined to ensure datasets were opHmized for analysis. The soluHon design integrated 
advanced analyHcs and data visualizaHon tools into exisHng IT infrastructure, ensuring scalability, 
security, and accessibility. ImplementaHon and outcome tesHng showcased the posiHve impact 
of the new soluHon on resource allocaHon and paHent care, culminaHng in recommendaHons for 
ongoing soluHon opHmizaHon to drive conHnuous improvements in healthcare resource 
allocaHon and paHent outcomes.
Overall, the project aims to conHnuously improve healthcare resource allocaHon and drive 
posiHve outcomes for paHents and healthcare providers by iteraHvely refining the soluHon 
through minimum viable product iteraHons.
